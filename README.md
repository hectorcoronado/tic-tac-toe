## Objective:

Build a tic-tac-toe game in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This was our first week's weekend assignment; our purpose was to implement conditionals and loops in JavaScript, writing simple and efficient functions, and trying to the best of our abilities to incorporate best practices such as DRY. Further, we were to get a better understanding of the DOM and how to modify it.
